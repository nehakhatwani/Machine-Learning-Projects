This ML project folder consists of:

🫀 Heart Disease Detection:
A machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical and health parameters. It leverages algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest for early and accurate diagnosis.

🧬 Thyroid Cancer Prediction:
A predictive model that classifies thyroid conditions as benign or malignant using patient data. Built using machine learning techniques to support efficient and data-driven cancer detection.

🐾 Animal Classification:
An image classification project that identifies animal species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Trained on image datasets to accurately recognize and categorize different animals.
